                    <p> The wonder years. <br> <br> During this decade I learned the basics of using a DOS prompt. I installed games and programs from floppy disk using a CLI.
                        The mid-90's was when I truly began to explore the web after my family purchased our very first computer, a Compaq Presario. I got up to speed with Windows while learning OSX at school using an Apple IIe (that we all shared.)

                    <p>My early days tinkering with electronics inspired me to pursue an audio engineering career. <br> <br> I decided to move to Orlando FL to attend Full Sail University. The knowledge I gained about the basics of digital design and audio engineering have continued to be a strong foundation throughout my life.
                        The fundementals of audio never change, although the way we use them continues to evolve. The same rules apply to the basics of HTML/CSS and digital design. My Web Dev journey had officially begun!

                    <p><em> MySpace has entered the chat...</em> <br> <br> Social media was on the rise during the mid-2000's. You had to have a seriously good (and tricked out) MySpace page to even think you were cool in the 00's. Learning how to edit CSS styles to add animation and color themes to your page was a vital skillset.

                    <p>If you stopped reading now you'd come to the end of my Web Dev journey. <br> <br> During this time I was committed to starting a family, raising my son and growing my career as an audio engineer. I produced & recorded entire albums of music for myself and others while working professionally in the live sound industry. My DJ hobby slowly grew into a full-time career allowing me to perform at music festivals, nightclubs, and special events for some of the biggest organizations in the world! 
                        ...until the pandemic changed everything. These industries were hit hard by the lockdown. I suddenly found myself with lots of time on my hands, looking for a change... I started to get back to my roots with computers. But what to do...<em>LIGHT BULB!</em> I <strong>declared</strong> myself a software developer!

                    <p>Okay, so now I'm a software developer. What does that even mean? <br> <br> It was time to go back to school. I started by reading books and listening to podcasts all about software engineering & computer science. I didn't know what they were talking about most of the time but whenever I came to a new term, I would stop to reserach that topic. (JSON, by the way, is not a reference to the months in a year.) 
                        My plan was working, I decided to design Apps, make games and create art using code. I put pen to paper creating lots of layouts for products to develop. I learned the basics of Xcode & Swift but quickly came to a dead-end. My UX was great but where do I keep all this data? It was time to learn about the full-stack!

                    <p>Teaching myself with online courses was going pretty good. <br> <br> I understood the basics of frontend design while starting to grasp what was going on behind the scenes. I realized that had to take my education to the next level if I wanted to be a serious software developer. There's an endless amount of programs out there offering to take you to the promised land. 
                        What path should I take? After careful consideration I decided the best path forward was to become a "Full Stack Web Developer." This would allow me to obtain a job in a growing industry without a CS degree. I decided that bootcamps were the best option but which one...</p>

                    <p> <em>A New Challenger Approaches...</em> <br> <br> I was feeling conflicted about which bootcamp to take. I was hoping to find something close to home that I could also attend in person. That's when I found out about the SCF Coding BootCamp Powered by Flatiron. This was <strong>PERFECT!</strong> I jumped at the chance to learn about this new program while working hard to find the resources to join. Everything I've learned so far in life has prepared me for this moment. I'm excited for this opportunity and can't wait to get started! </p>
