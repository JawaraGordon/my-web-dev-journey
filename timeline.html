                    <p> The wonder years. <br> <br> During this decade I learned the basics of using a DOS prompt. I installed games and programs using a CLI and floppy disks.
                        The mid-90's was when I truly began to explore when my family purchased my very first computer, a Compaq Presario. I got up to speed with Windows while learning OSX at school using an Apple IIe (that we all shared.)

                    <p>My early days with electronics inspired me to become an audio engineer. <br> <br> I decided to move to Orlando FL to attend Full Sail University. The knowledge I gained with the basics of webdesign and audio engineering have continued to be a strong foundation throughout my career.
                        The fundementals of audio never change, although the way we use them continues to evolve. The same rules apply to the basics of HTML/CSS and digital design. My Web Dev journey had begun and I didn't even relaize it!

                    <p><em> MySpace has entered the chat...</em> <br> <br> Social media was on the rise during the mid-2000's. You had to have a seriously good (and tricked out) MySpace page to even think you were cool in the 00's. Learning how to edit CSS styles to add animation and color themes to your page was a vital skillset.

                    <p>If you stopped reading now you'd come to the end of my Web Dev journey. <br> <br> During this time I was committed to starting a family, raising my son and growing my audio engineer career. It was going great! I produced & recorded entire albums of music for myself and others while working professionally in the live sound industry. My DJ hobby slowly grew into a full-time career allowing me to perform at music festivals, nightclubs, and for some of the biggest organizations in the world! 
                        ...until the pandemic changed everything. These industries were hit hard by the lockdown. I suddenly found myself with lots of time on my hands and looking for a change... I started to get back to my roots with computers. But what to do...<em>LIGHT BULB</em> I declared myself a software developer!

                    <p>Okay, so now I'm a software developer. What does that even mean? <br> <br> It was time to go back to school to find out how. I started by reading books and listening to podcasts all about software engineering & computer science. I didn't know what they were talking about most of the time but whenever I came to a new term, I would stop and reserach that topic. (BTW - JSON is not a reference to months in the year.) 
                        My plan was working, I decided I wanted to design Apps, make games and create art using code. I put pen to paper creating lots of layouts for products to develop. I learned the basics of Xcode and Swift but quickly came to a dead-end. My UX was great but where do I keep all this data? It was time to learn about the full-stack!

                    <p>Teaching myself with online courses was going pretty good. <br> <br> I understood the basics of frontend design while starting to grasp what was going on behind the scenes to make it all happen. I needed to take my education to the next level if I wanted to pursue a serious career as a software developer. There's an endless amount of programs out there offering to take you to the promised land. 
                        What path should I take? After careful consideration I decided the best path forward was to become a "Full Stack Web Developer." This would allow me to obtain a job in a growing industry without a CS degree. I decided a bootcamp was the best option for me but which one...</p>

                    <p> <em>A New Challenger Approaches...</em> <br> <br> I was feeling conflicted about which bootcamp to take. I was hoping to find something close to home that I could also attend in person. That's when I found out about the SCF Coding BootCamp Powered by Flatiron &trade; This was <strong>PERFECT!</strong> I jumped at the chance to learn about this brand new program while working hard to find the resources to join. Everything I've learned so far in life has prepared me for this moment. I'm excited for this opportunity and can't wait to get started! </p>
